# Django front-end framework research report
The propose of this report is to record my research results on finding a front-end framewok that could well cooperate with Django.

## Preamble
If we can't figure out how to deploy these front-end frameworks with Django, all the discussions are meaningless. If we can find out at least one framework that works with Django, no matter which one, any of them is much better than jQuery. 

## Why do we need framework
Using pure javascript is like walking on your own feet. You can go anywhere without any constrain, but you will get tired soon and can't go far. jQuery is like a bicycle. You can learn how to ride it in less than a day and it will help you go further with less effort. But it's still not far enough. Frameworks are like cars. It will take you a month or longer to learn to drive. And you may need weeks of time just to be familiar with starting the car. It wouble be difficult at the beginning. Once you overcome those difficulities, all the beautiful scenery in distance are now yours. 
 

## Why Vue
1. Vue is easy to learn and well documented.
2. Vue can perfectly cooperate with jQuery.
3. I've already found a way to deploy vue in our server.
